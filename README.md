webdriver
=========

Provides WebDriver bindings for Dart. These use the WebDriver JSON interface,
and as such, require the use of the WebDriver remote server.

Installing
----------


1. Depend on it

   Add this to your package's pubspec.yaml file:

   ```YAML
   dependencies:
     webdriver: any
   ```

   If your package is an application package you should use any as the version
   constraint.

2. Install it

   If you're using the Dart Editor, choose:

   ```
   Menu > Tools > Pub Install
   ```

   Or if you want to install from the command line, run:

   ```
   $ pub install
   ```

3. Import it

   Now in your Dart code, you can use:

   ```Dart
   import 'package:webdriver/webdriver.dart';
   ```

Testing
-------

To run the tests, you need to first run selenium-server-standalone, which you
can download from https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads.
